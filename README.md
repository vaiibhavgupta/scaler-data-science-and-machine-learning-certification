# Data Science and Machine Learning Certification at Scaler

I am currently enrolled in a Data Science and Machine Learning certification at Scaler. The certification will help me in building strong foundations and in enhancing my knowledge of the following topics:

  1. Python, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures
  2. Relational Database and Structured Query Language
  3. Data Science libraries in Python
  4. Probability Theory and Distributions
  5. Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
  6. Experiment Design and Hypothesis Testing
  7. Specialization: Data Science and Deep Learning with AI
    - Calculus
    - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
    - Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
    - Neural Networks and TensorFlow
  8. Elective: MLOps and Data Engineering
    - Docker
    - Amazon Web Services
    - Apache Spark  
  9. Computer Science Fundamentals
  10. Advance Data Structures and Algorithms

I joined Scaler because their curriculum does not concentrate only on theory. Instead, it assigns a significant amount of weightage to assignments, projects, and mock interviews to gauge a student’s progress.

The “Descriptive and Inferential Statistics” module was completed in December 2022, and the module on “Experiment Design and Hypothesis Testing” commenced on 2nd January 2023.

Some of the projects I have completed in this certification as part of previous modules are:
  
  1. SQL: Target Retail
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Netflix
  3. Probability and Descriptive Statistics: Aerofit
  4. Central Limit Theorem: Walmart

This certification will solidify my foundations on some of the most relevant concepts in Data Science and put me in a better position to pursue my Master’s degree.

The certification is scheduled to be completed approximately in July 2023.
